## Status

## What is this and for whom?

This tutorial is **NOT** intended to show you how to use specific features to write a CMake file, although showing the features is sometimes inevitable in order to explain the topics. If you want to write a CMake file to build the project at hand, refer to the official [CMake Tutorial](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html).

Instead, this tutorial means to **provide a bird's-eye view of CMake so you will see all the important parts of this tool** and how these parts are related to each other. Therefore, the best readers of this tutorial are **those who have used CMake for a while and want to get a full grasp of this tool in order to harness its full power**. When you need the details, the [official documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/index.html) is always there and informative.
